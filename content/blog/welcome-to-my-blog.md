## Finally Built My Dream Site! ðŸŽ‰ (or the first version of it)

I've been wanting to create a site that could hold both my resume and blog for ages, but I always got stuck on the design phase. You know how it is - you start with grand plans, spend hours researching themes, get overwhelmed by choices, and then... nothing happens!

Well, I finally broke through that barrier! The secret? I discovered that AI tools like Claude can help accelerate the entire development process. Instead of getting bogged down in design decisions, I focused on what I actually wanted to share and let modern tools handle the heavy lifting.

If you're curious about how I built this site using Hugo, AWS, and Claude AI, check out my detailed guide: [Building a Professional Blog with Claude, Hugo, and AWS](/blog/building-blog-with-claude-hugo-aws/).

## What You'll Find Here

### Technical Deep Dives
I'll share detailed walkthroughs of solutions around automation, testing and cloud infrastructure. Expect posts about:
- Deploying static sites using modern tools
- Automated tools and how they're used
- CI/CD pipeline optimisation
- Infrastructure as Code best practices

### Lessons Learned
Every production incident teaches us something. I'll share sanitized versions of real-world challenges and how we solved them.

### Tool Reviews and Comparisons
The DevOps toolchain is constantly evolving. I'll review new tools and compare them with established solutions.

### Career Insights
Thoughts on growing as a DevOps engineer, team dynamics, and industry trends.

## My Current Tech Stack

This blog itself is built with technologies I use and recommend:
- **Hugo**: Fast static site generation
- **Blowfish Theme**: Clean, responsive design
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront**: Reliable, scalable hosting
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD pipeline
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code

The entire setup demonstrates the principles I advocate for: automation, version control, and infrastructure as code.

## Why "BuildWithEM"?

If you were wondering about the site name "buildwithem", this comes from my initials (E.M.) combined with my passion for building things with technology. Whether it's automating infrastructure, creating CI/CD pipelines, or building this blog itself, I love the process of creating solutions that gives us time back to do other things! Plus, it's a nice play on "build with them" - because the best DevOps work is always collaborative.

The name perfectly captures what this blog is about: sharing how I build things, the tools I use, and hopefully inspiring you to build something awesome too.
