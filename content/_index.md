## Hi, Kia Ora! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a DevOps Engineer passionate about building reliable, scalable infrastructure and automating all the things. This site is both my portfolio and my learning journal - a place where I document my journey through the ever-evolving world of cloud technologies.

### Current Focus
I'm currently diving deep into:
- AWS Architecture best practices including achieving the AWS SAA certification
- Using AI to build tools and sites quickly
- Kubernetes and its different use cases
- Platform and Site Reliability Engineering
