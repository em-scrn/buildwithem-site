## My Journey

I started my technical career providing operational support for Sky TV systems, where I discovered my passion for troubleshooting, streamlining processes, and efficiency. Using my knowledge of Sky TV systems, I moved to Vodafone NZ troubleshooting broadband and hardware issues. I was able to join the Vodafone Discover Graduate program where I gained exposure to the telco and IT business.

I then did a rotation in the internal OSS DevOps team where I fostered my curiosity for automation using scripts with bash and python, and robotic-process automation (RPA). The transition to cloud-first DevOps opened up a world of possibilities, from Infrastructure as Code to event-driven architectures.

### What Drives Me

**Automation First**: If I have to do something more than twice, I'll automate it. This philosophy has saved countless hours - like the 28 hours per month I saved through RPA implementation at Vodafone NZ.

**Measurable Impact**: I believe in metrics-driven improvements. Whether it's reducing infrastructure setup time from 8 hours to 10 minutes with Terraform, or cutting testing time from 2 days to 5 minutes with automated frameworks.

**Continuous Learning**: Technology evolves rapidly, especially in the cloud space and infrastructure space. I'm always experimenting with new services and architectural patterns.

**Quality Through Testing**: Having built automated testing frameworks that dramatically improve software quality, I'm passionate about shift-left testing practices.

### Beyond Work

When I'm not learning about the latest cloud tools or writing automation scripts, you'll find me:
- Watching YouTube videos about travel vlogs, emerging technologies, and interior design
- Playing with my cavoodles Faker and Luna
- Enjoying Melbourne's diverse cuisines
